# Buenas! My name is Tinya
## I'm backend Java developer based in sunny Barcelona ☀️

I have experience creating backend part of applications, as well as designing, implementing and optimizing databases. 

I love to do invisible, but very important work. In my daily life, I see Postman and Swagger more often than beautiful website interfaces, and my dreams at night consist of database rows and Java and Spring Boot code. 

I'm an active GitHub user, as you can see, because I made myself a nice welcome message. I can work in teams using branching, and I also consider the terminal my co-commander. 

You can find me here:
Stacks I work with:
Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, SQL, Maven, GIT, Docker, Postman, Swagger, Linux.
